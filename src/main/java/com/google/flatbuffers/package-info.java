/**
 * 
 * According to the official FlatBuffers project, FlatBuffers is a serialization
 * library for games and other memory constrained apps.
 * 
 * FlatBuffers allows you to directly access serialized data without
 * unpacking/parsing it first, while still having great forwards/backwards
 * compatibility.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, FlatBuffers project does not publish any artifacts to the
 * Maven Central Repository. In this fork, I keep a separate and intact copy of
 * the FlatBuffers Java API for the purpose of publishing artifacts.
